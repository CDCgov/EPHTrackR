## First stable release of EPHTrackR!

- list_geographies() function deprecated and replaced by list_GeographicItems()
- list_geography_types() function deprecated and replaced by list_GeographicTypes()
- list_stratification_levels() deprecated and replaced by list_StratificationLevels()
- list_stratification_values() deprecated and replaced by list_StratificationTypes()
- update_inventory() function deprecated
- list_temporal() function deprecated and replaced by list_TemporalItems(). Note that "child temporal items" no longer exist in the output. "Temporal items" represent the lowest level temporal period reported for a measure. Some measures may still have "parent temporal items" if the lowest-level "temporal item" is sub-annual.
- get_data() function now uses a POST request to contact the API instead of GET requests to allow for long API calls (e.g., situations where many years are called)
- Removed geotypeID argument in favor of specifying either geography names or IDs in the geo_type argument
- Removed strat_levelID argument in favor of specifying either stratification names, abbreviations or IDs in the strat_level argument
- Now allowing full stratification names to be specified in the strat_level argument
- Advanced options can now be requested for particular levels (e.g., male only) using the stratItems argument in the get_data() function
- Separate output columns listing each stratification level have been added to get_data() outputs with multiple stratItems (advanced options)
- Added support for Tracking API tokens in all function calls
- Created the tracking_api_token() function to save Tracking API token so that they don't need to specified in every call
- Intelligible error messages are now produced if the API returns a 404 status code
- Many other error messages were added to clarify common problems
- Data that were previously packaged with the package have been removed in favor or direct calls to the Tracking API
- Removed requirement to enter the format of measure entries (e.g., ID, name etc.)
