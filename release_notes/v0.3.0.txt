Release v1.0.0

- list_geographies() function deprecated and replaced by list_GeographicItems()
- list_geography_types() function deprecated and replaced by list_GeographicTypes()
- list_stratification_levels() deprecated and replaced by list_StratificationLevels()
- list_stratification_values() deprecated and replaced by list_StratificationTypes()
- update_inventory() function deprecated
- list_temporal() function deprecated and replaced by list_TemporalItems(). Note that "child temporal items" no longer exist in the output. "Temporal items" represent the lowest level temporal period reported for a measure. Some measures may still have "parent temporal items" if the lowest-level "temporal item" is sub-annual.
- get_data() function now uses a POST request to contact the API instead of a GET request to allow for long API calls (e.g., situations where many years are called)
- removed geotypeID argument in favor of specifying either geography names or IDs in the geo_type argument
- removed strat_levelID argument in favor of specifying either stratification names, abbreviations or IDs in the strat_level argument
- allowing full statification names to be specified in the strat_level argument
- advanced options can now be requested for particular levels (e.g., male only) using the stratItems argument in get_data()
- separate output column listing each stratification level has been added to get_data() outputs with multiple stratItems (advanced options)
- added support for Tracking API tokens in all function calls
- created the tracking_api_token() function to save Tracking API tokens so that they don't need to be called in each function
- intelligible error messages are now produced if the API returns a 404 status code
- many other error messages were added to identify common problems
- measures data that was prevoiusly packaged with the package has been removed in favor or direct calls to the Tracking API to acquire measures data
